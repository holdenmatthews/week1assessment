// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which the requirements to reach the end goal of the software are laid out."
const design = "This is the third step, in which the creation of the software prototype begins."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step, in which the requirements needed to reach the goals from planning will be added to the code."
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, in which the software is put through tests and edited continually until the final product is reached."
const maintain = "This is the sixth and final step, in which the software must be continually updated. This step is important too!"
